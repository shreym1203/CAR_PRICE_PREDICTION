# CAR_PRICE_PREDICTION
The dataset contains nine features in total related to the sales of second hand cars of different models of Audi brand .In total 10668 samples are present in the dataset.

model – Model of the Audi car sold
year – Year in which the car was sold
price -  Price at which the car was sold
transmission – Transmission of the car sold
mileage – Distance travelled
fuelType – Type of fuel used in running the car
tax – Tax payed while buying the car
mpg – Miles per Gallon
engine size – Size of engine in litres. (1000cc = 1L)

AIM:
The aim of the project is to create a price prediction model with high accuracy.

EVALUATION:
We find that Linear Regression is the worst performing model with around 78% accuracy on both, train and test set which implicates that the price does not show linearity.
The best performing model is Random Forest with 99% accuracy on train set and more than 95% accuracy on test set.

CONCLUSION:
I performed various different steps required in a data science project. I learned different steps of data preprocessing like encoding, standardization, transforming dataset, train-test split.
After data preprocessing, I applied 5 ML models in order to get the best price prediction. Random Forest was the best performing model and hece was chosen for the price prediction with an overall accuracy of 98%.
